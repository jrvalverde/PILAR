# PILAR
Protein Identification and Library Access Resource (a suite of programs I wrote circa 1988-1989)

It was able to access all the major database formats in use at the time (which in modern, Fasta-Only
format times may seem strange), and contained routines to predict secondary structure, analyze 
databases, compare proteins by secondary structure and search protein databases using secondary
structure motifs as a pattern. It also contained various other tools like predicting charge or
identifying some special proteins.
